Hi, my name is Jason Wilson.

I am currently working toward my Master of Science in Software Application Development,

which I expect to complete by mid-summer 2025.

After that, my goal is to pursue a Doctorate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I’m looking to collaborate on any type of Java project, so feel free to reach out, and I will help in any way I can.

I am particularly interested in utilizing Spring Framework in Artificial Intelligence Information Systems along with

statistical infrenece on time series data.

Let’s intelligently automate everything! :)
