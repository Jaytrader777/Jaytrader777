<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>Hello, I’m Jason Wilson, a passionate and dedicated professional with a rich background in technology and entrepreneurship.
  My journey began at the age of 12, when I wrote my first computer program on a TRS-80 Model III Radio Shack computer,
  igniting a lifelong love for programming and technology.
</p>

<h2>Education and Certifications</h2>

<p>
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Programming from American Military University
and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Software Application Development
at Southern New Hampshire University. My academic journey has been marked by a perfect 4.0 GPA, 
reflecting my commitment to excellence. I have also completed multiple certifications in Java from
Microsoft and Duke University, enhancing my skills and knowledge in programming.
</p>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<p>My professional career includes significant roles at Amazon, where I served as a
Delivery Station Area Manager and a Fulfillment Center employee. My experience at Amazon
allowed me to hone my skills in data analytics and IT network management.
I developed algorithms to download, clean, and organize data from multiple servers simultaneaously.
My Java based automated systems when ran created custom reports utilizing custom
templates, reducing report generation time from nearly two hours to just seconds.
</p>

<h2>Entrepreneurial Ventures</h2>
<p>
I have owned and operated several diversified small businesses, including a low-power television station, 
a mortgage company, retail store kiosks, and a BBQ restaurant. These ventures have provided me with a 
unique blend of technical and business acumen.

Notably, as the President and Owner of Proclaim Broadcasting Inc., 
I built a television station from the ground up. This involved
meticulous paperwork with the FAA and FCC, constructing 100’ and 500’ towers,
and working closely with licensed engineers to ensure everything met the necessary specifications.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>

<p>
Beyond my professional life, I am an avid builder of radio-controlled cars and airplanes, 
a hobby I have enjoyed since childhood. I also find great joy in fishing,
which provides a peaceful escape and a chance to connect with nature.
</p>

<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>

<p>
Looking ahead, I am excited about the prospects of advancing my education further, potentially pursuing
a Doctorate in Artificial Intelligence. My ultimate goal is to become a professor, sharing my knowledge
and experience with future generations of IT and programming students.
</p> </br>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries
of technology and making meaningful contributions to the field.
